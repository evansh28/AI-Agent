Subject: Application for Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend work on [date(s) of leave]. I am in need of some time off to attend to personal matters.

I understand the importance of my role in the team and the impact my absence may have. However, I assure you that I have taken all necessary steps to ensure that my responsibilities are covered during my absence. I have delegated my tasks to [colleague's name(s)] and have provided them with all the necessary information and resources to complete the tasks.

I will be checking my email periodically during my leave and will respond to any urgent matters as soon as possible. If there are any issues that arise that cannot be handled by my colleagues, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I apologize for any inconvenience my absence may cause and I appreciate your understanding in this matter. I look forward to returning to work refreshed and ready to contribute to the team's success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
