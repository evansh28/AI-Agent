Subject: Application for Leave for Two Days

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to attend work for the next two days due to personal reasons. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to ensure that my responsibilities are covered during my absence.

I will be checking my email periodically throughout my leave and will respond to any urgent matters as soon as possible. If there are any tasks that need to be completed during this time, please let me know and I will make arrangements to have them done before I leave.

I am grateful for your understanding and support during this time. Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
